# d3-grouped-line-chart-with-legend

This is a grouped line chart created using the d3.js library. It includes styled tooltips that display additional information not visible on the static chart, as well as a legend that becomes page-able as the number of groups increases beyond a certain point.

In this case, the chart shows the estimated inventory lifecycle for a particular auto dealership. The estimates were generated from a Bayesian survival model.
